# * Problem Statement * #

# Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
#
# There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
#
# Examples
# [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
# [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

    # has the same function as the code block of code above â†‘

    #     for num in seq:

    #             soma+=1

    #     if (soma%2)!=0:

    #     return i
